# 3F0-Coding-Challenge

Create a php file which geocodes an address using the API of your choice and returns lat/long coordinates.

Create a responsive html page that uses custom fonts of your choice with some dummy content. On the page have an input field for an address, and a button which sends that address to the php file, receives back the lat/long, and opens a modal which contains a google map centered on those lat/long coordinates.
